<p>Scanduino - an Arduino sketch to control a DSLR based film scanner</p>

<p>Flickr member Really Small has created a program called Stackduino, see: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reallysmall/8270022807/in/photostream/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/reallysmall/8270022807/in/photostream/</a> </p>

<p>Stackduino's relevance to the plans of Scanduino was immediately recognized. ReallySmall is very generously offering his expert attention to adapting Stackduino to Scanduino : ) From all of us, THANK YOU! </p>

<p>The ultimate goal of Scanduino is to automate the digitizing of a sheet of film by capturing an array of images taken by a DSLR for later stitching via panoramic stitching program.</p>
