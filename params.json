ReallySmall is very generously offering his expert attention to adapting Stackduino to Scanduino : ) From all of us, THANK YOU! \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of Scanduino is to automate the digitizing of a sheet of film by capturing an array of images taken by a DSLR for later stitching via panoramic stitching program.\r\n\r\nScanduino development discussion at Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/35334802@N04/8472236472/in/photostream/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
