Scanduino -  an Arduino sketch to control a DSLR based film scanner

Flickr member Really Small has created a program called Stackduino, see:

Stackduino's relevance to the plans of Scanduino was immediately recognized. 
ReallySmall is very generously offering his expert attention to adapting 
Stackduino to Scanduino : ) From all of us, THANK YOU! 

The ultimate goal of Scanduino is to automate the digitizing of a sheet of film
by capturing an array of images taken by a DSLR for later stitching 
via panoramic stitching program.
